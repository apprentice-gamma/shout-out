# shout-out
MEWER
Super Awesome Posi Motivational Web App

This web app allows users on a team to give each other "mews", essentially a shout-out for a job well done.

These mews are anonymous and time-stamped, so people can see their accolades, what it was for, and when it happened. Warm and fuzzy, right?

Mewer is currently in an early alpha stage, and uses AngularJS on a MEAN stack to do its business.

FUTURE FEATURES:

"Headbumps" - an upvote-like feature for giving other people's mews a +1.

"Weekly Mews" - a weekly leaderboard and chart of mews given and received.

"CATegories" - Different categories for different types of accolades... personal favors, project-related accomplishments, good deeds, etc.

Admins - The ability for users to be a team admin: customize categories, edit or delete mews, add, edit or delete team members, etc.
